           FILE HANDLING :---
The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:

"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist.

"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist.

"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist.

"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists.

"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode.

"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images).

"+" - Open a disk file for updating (reading and writing) 

syntax - f = open("file.txt", "rt")

Using the with statement
You can also use the with statement when opening a file:  with open("demofile.txt") as f: print(f.read())
